- 👋 Hi, I’m an enthusiastic Frontend Developer who enjoys developing responsive web applications and websites and has been working with startups for the past 2 years.
- 🌱 My strongest skills lie within React and Angular Frameworks. I have been learning front-end development for the last 4 years from some private institutes and online courses. I additionally learned about testing libraries from my past experiences which leads me to have an interest in automated testing.
- 💞️ I am looking for a Frontend Developer position or a Fullstack position which will help me to gain more knowledge about backend skills. As a fast learner, I will be happy to adapt any new stack which is required by the clients.
